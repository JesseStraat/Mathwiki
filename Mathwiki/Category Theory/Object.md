In a [[Category|category]], an **object** is a "vertex" of the category. Its precise nature varies between categories, but in the context of set-theoretic categories, it is usually a set with some properties.
## Special objects

A **terminal object** is an object $Y$ such that for every other object $X$, there is exactly one morphism $X\to Y$.
The dual concept of a terminal object is an [initial object](<#Initial objects>)
### Initial object
An **initial object** is an object $X$ such that for every other object $Y$, there is exactly one morphism $X\to Y$.
