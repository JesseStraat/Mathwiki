The section on **logic** is reserved for some articles on the foundation of mathematics, and some terminology used from the philosophical field of formal logic.

Since the author of this Mathwiki does not have the sufficient background in logic to produce the articles on logic from his own knowledge, large portions of this section are inspired by the book *Sets, models and proofs* by Ieke Moerdijk and Jaap van Oosten.

Whenever in this section we use the term "set", we mean so as in the way of naïve set theory — it is not a formal set in [[ZFC Set Theory|ZFC set theory]].
