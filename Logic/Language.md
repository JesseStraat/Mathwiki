## Definition
A **language** $L$ is given by three sets of *symbols*, being *constants* $\mathrm{con}(L)$, *function symbols* $\mathrm{fun}(L)$ and *relation symbols* $\mathrm{rel}(L)$. Moreover, to each function and relation symbol is associated a natural numbers (excluding $0$) called the *arity*.

In addition to these symbols, every language also has the following auxiliary symbols:
- A countably infinite set of *variables*;
- Equality $=$;
- Absurdity $\perp$;
- Connectives $\wedge$ ("and"), $\vee$ ("or"), $\Rightarrow$ ("if ... then"), $\neg$ ("not");
- Quantifiers $\forall$ ("for all"), $\exists$ ("there exists").
These auxiliary symbols are distinct and are not contained in any of the previously defined symbols.
