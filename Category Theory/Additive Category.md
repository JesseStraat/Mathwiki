## Definition
Recall from [[Enriched Category#$ mathrm{Ab}$-enriched category|the article on enriched categories]] that an $\mathrm{Ab}$-enriched category is a [[Category|category]] $\mathcal{C}$ such that its hom-sets are Abelian groups and its composition is bilinear. Recall also that all terminal objects and initial objects are zero objects, and that products coincide with coproducts, which we call biproducts.

An $\mathrm{Ab}$-enriched category is called an **additive category** if it has all finite biproducts.
