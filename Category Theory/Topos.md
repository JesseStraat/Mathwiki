## Definition
If a [[Category|category]] $\mathcal{C}$ has [[Limit|finite limits]], is [[Exponential object|Cartesian closed]] and has a [[Subobject|subobject classifier]], then it is called an **(elementary) topos**.
## Examples
### $\mathrm{Set}$
As we have seen in the relevant articles, we know that $\mathrm{Set}$ satisfies all properties of a topos.
