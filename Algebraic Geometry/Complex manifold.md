A **complex manifold** is a [[Differentiable Manifold]] whose charts map to $\mathbb{C}^k$, rather than $\mathbb{R}^k$, and the transition functions must be holomorphic, rather than differentiable. Moreover, morphisms between complex manifolds are holomorphisms, rather than smooth functions.

A morphism to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is called a **meromorphism**. The set of meromorphisms of some manifold $X$ is also denoted $\mathcal{M}(X)$.
