## Definition
A **Riemann surface** is a $1$-dimensional [[Complex manifold|complex manifold]].
## Recommended reading
This page is an adaptation of a summary I made on Riemann surfaces, based on Rick Miranda's *Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces*, and excellent book on the topic.
## Multiplicity
Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a [[Complex manifold|morphism]] between Riemann surfaces. The **multiplicity** of $f$ at some point $p\in X$ is the unique number $\mathrm{mult}_p(f)\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$ such that there exist charts $\varphi,\psi$ around $p$ and $f(p)$, respectively, such that $\psi\circ f\circ\varphi^{-1}(z) = z^{\mathrm{mult}_p(f)}$. The multiplicity is also known as the **ramification index**.
We say that $p$ is a **ramification point** if $\mathrm{mult}_p(f) > 1$. We then also say that $f(p)$ is a **branch point**.

The **degree** of $f$ is given by $\mathrm{deg}(f) = \sum_{p\in f^{-1}\{q\}}\mathrm{mult}_p(f)$ for $q$ any point in the image of $f$. The degree does not depend on which point $q$ you choose.
## Order
Let $f\colon X\to \mathbb{P}^1$ be some morphism. The **order** of $f$ at some point $p\in X$ is the unique number $\mathrm{ord}_p(f)\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that for all charts $\varphi$, $f\circ\varphi^{-1}(z) = \sum_{n=\mathrm{ord}_p(f)}^\infty a_nz^n$ with $a_{\mathrm{ord}_p(f)}\neq 0$.

Points with negative order are called **poles**, while points with positive order are called **vanishing points**.

If $\mathrm{ord}_p(f)\neq 0$, then $\mathrm{mult}_p(f) = |\mathrm{ord}_p(f)|$.
## Divisor
A **divisor** is some map $D\colon X\to \mathbb{Z}$ with finite support.
We say that  a divisor is effective it is is nowhere negative.
Every morphism has an associated divisor $\mathrm{div}(f) = \sum_{p\in X}\mathrm{ord}_p(f)[p]$.
We call a divisor principle if it is equal to the divisor of some morphism.
The **degree** of a divisor is $\mathrm{deg}(D) = \sum_{p\in X}D(p)$.

Two divisors are **equivalent**  if their difference is a principle divisor.

Given a divisor $D$, we define the set of equivalent effective divisors
$$L(D) := \{f\in\mathcal{M}(X)\ |\ \mathrm{ord}_p(f)\geq D(p)\text{ for all $p\in X$}\}.$$This is a complex [[Vector Space|vector space]]. Its dimension is denoted $\ell(D)$. In general, $\ell(0) = 1$ and either $\ell(D+[p]) = \ell(D) + 1$ or $\ell(D+[p]) = \ell(D)$.
## $1$-forms
Given any $1$-form $\omega$, every other $1$-form is given by $f\omega$ for some meromorphic $f$.
The divisor of a $1$-form (calculated locally as the divisor of a representing function) is called a canonical divisor. Every canonical divisor has equal degree, from which we define the **genus** of a Riemann surface as $g = 1+\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{deg}(K)$.
## Linear system
A **linear system** of a divisor $D$ is the set $\{D + \mathrm{div}(f)\ |\ f\in V\}$, with $V$ some linear subspace of $L(D)$. If $V=L(D)$, we denote the linear system $|D|$ and call it the **complete linear system** of $D$.

Note that linear systems are not vector spaces. Rather, they are the projective space generated by $V$.

A **basepoint** of a linear system $L$ is some point $p\in X$ that is in the support of all divisors in $L$.

The dimension of $|D|$ is $\ell(D)-1$, and is sometimes denoted $r(D)$.

A linear system of degree $d$ and dimension $r$ is denoted $g^r_d$. If such a linear system is basepoint free, then there is a corresponding non-degenerate morphism $\varphi\colon X\to \mathbb{P}^r$ with $\varphi(p) = [1:f_1(p):\dots :f_r(p)]$, with $f_i$ a basis of $V$.

If a Riemann surface has a $g^1_2$, we say that it is *hyperelliptic*.
## Weierstraß point
The **gap sequence** of some point is $G_p = \{n\in\mathbb{Z}\ |\ \ell(n[p]) = \ell((n-1)p)\}$.
A **Weierstraß point** is a point such that $G_p \neq \{1,2,\dots,g\}$.
A gap sequence must always have $g$ entries, and $n\notin G_p$ if and only if there exists a $f$ with $\mathrm{ord}_p(f) = -n$.
$\mathbb{N}\setminus G_p$ is a sub-[[Monoid|monoid]] of $\mathbb{N}$.
The **Weierstraß weight** of $p$ is $w_p = \sum_{n\in G_p}n - \frac{g(g+1)}{2}$, and is positive whenever $p$ is a Weierstraß point.
**Theorem:** $\sum_{p\in X} w_p (g-1)g(g+1)$.
## Examples
### Affine plane curve
For $f\colon \mathbb{C}^2\to\mathbb{C}$ a non-constant polynomial, if it has no singular points $f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial w} = 0$, then its zero locus $V(f)$ is a Riemann surface.
### Projective plane curve
Let $F\colon \mathbb{C}^3\to\mathbb{C}$ be a non-constant homogeneous polynomial. If it has no singular points $F = \frac{\partial F}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial Y} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial Z} = 0$, then its projective zero locus $V(F)\subseteq \mathbb{P}^2$ is a compact Riemann surface.
## Propositions
**Theorem:** (Implicit function theorem) Let $f\colon U\to \mathbb{C}^m$, with $U$ an open in $\mathbb{C}^{n+m}$, and $p=(a,b)\in U$. If $\det(J^w_p(f))\neq 0$, with $J_p^w(f)$ the Jacobian matrix in the last $m$ variables, then there exist opens $V\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$, $W\subseteq \mathbb{C}^m$ such that $V\times W\subseteq U$ and we have a $g\colon V\to W$ such that $g(a) = b$ and $$\mathrm{Graph}(g) = \{(z,w)\in V\times W\ |\ f(z,w) = f(p)\}.$$

**Theorem:** (Riemann-Hurwitz formula) Given any morphism $f\colon X\to Y$, we have
$$2g_X - 2 = \mathrm{deg}(f)(2g_Y-2) + \sum_{p\in X}(\mathrm{mult}_p(f) - 1).$$
**Theorem:** (Riemann-Roch formula) Given any divisor $D$ and canonical divisor $K$,
$$\ell(D)-\ell(K-D) = \mathrm{deg}(D) + 1 - g.$$
**Proposition:** Every compact Riemann surface embeds into $\mathbb{P}^3$.
**Theorem:** (Hurwitz theorem) If $g\geq 2$, then $\#\mathrm{Aut}(X) \leq 42(2g-2)$.
