Set theory is based on [[Logic|logic]]. Every set theory is an axiomisation or [[Theory|theory]] in the [[Language|language]] of sets.


The language of sets has no constants or functions. One might choose to include the empty set as a constant, but its existence is guaranteed by the non-emptiness condition of models and axioms of the specific theories that we consider. Set theory only contains the $2$-ary relation symbol $\in$.
